# QUAC-8 - The QUartered Analog Computer

This was my first foray into HTML/CSS/JS when I actually got something done (mostly).

Beware -- it's highly undocumented and probably will always be.

## This repo depends on:
- [imaya/zlib.js](https://github.com/imaya/zlib.js) - a compact zlib, deflate, inflate, and zip library in JavaScript
- [mathiasbynens/he](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he) - a robust HTML entity encoder/decoder written in JavaScript
- [hlorenzi/customasm](https://github.com/hlorenzi/customasm) - an assembler for custom, user-defined instruction sets

-----------
If anyone's reading this far into the README, I'd be quite surprised.
